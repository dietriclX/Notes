# Installation

Download image "**AMD64 Memstick USB (..., All Other Intel/AMD 64-bit)**" from "[netgate: > NETGATE INSTALLER](https://shop.netgate.com/products/netgate-installer)".

## Prerequisites

- A Router
  - LAN interface - LAN Cable #1
- A Workstation
  - LAN interface - LAN Cable #2
- An Intel/AMD 64-bit machine
  - DVI/HDMI/VGA interface - Monitor
  - LAN interface fwwaninterfacefw- LAN Cable #1
  - LAN interface fwlan0interfacefw - n/a
  - LAN interface fwlan1interfacefw - n/a
  - LAN interface fwlan2interfacefw - n/a
  - LAN interface fwlan3interfacefw - LAN Cable #2
  - USB interface - Keyboard
  - USB interface - USB-Stick with pfSense install image.

Note #1: *The "LAN interface fwwaninterfacefw" is the onboard LAN interface. The "LAN interface fwlan0interfacefw" to "LAN interface fwlan3interfacefw" are those from the LAN PCI Express card. Use the "LAN interface fwlan3interfacefw" to avoid mixing up the order of interfaces, once the "LAN Bridge" got setup.*

Note #2: *For the initial installation the "**LAN Cable #2**" needs not to be connected. Establish the connection to the workstation, once you start with section "**[Configuration - 2. Part: Console](#configuration---2-part-console)**".*

Note #3: *Once the system is good enough configured to be accessible via the browser, Monitor & Keyboard are no longer required, but the Workstation needs to be connected to the LAN interface.*

## The goal

For the internal SDD card, we will be using the standard File System ZFS.

The machine has one on-board LAN interface (fwwaninterfacefw) and a quad port LAN card (fwlan0interfacefw-fwlan3interfacefw). The interfaces will be defined as follows.

- WAN  -> fwwaninterfacefw; DHCP Client
- LAN  -> fwlan3interfacefw; Static IP Address `fwlanipv4addressfw` with DHCP Server service IP-Range `fwlandhcpstartipv4addressfw` to `fwlandhcpendipv4addressfw`

Note: *Neither interface assignment nor the IP Address information was taken over from the setup (CUI-Wizard). Using the Console, We have to correct the assignment and IP Address.*

## Start-UP

In the BIOS Setting, enable boot from USB & removable media.

With the USB Media inserted, press F12 during boot to get the option to choose a boot partition.

# Add-On

## Certificate Usage

Depending on the scenario, for which the router is planned to be used, the (Intermediate) Certificate Authority and Certificate for the webConfigurator are configurated differently.

### Scenario: Router without OpenVPN

It is planned to 

- not setup and manage an OpenVPN server on the pfSense system
- not use Client Certificates for user authentication on the pfSense system
- create the certfiate for the webConfigurator outside the pfSense system

Therefore only the CA Certificate without the key has to be installed.

Steps to follow are

1. "Configure Certificate Authority"
2. "Configure Web Certificate"
3. "Activate Own Web Certificate"
4. "Test Own Web Certificate"

### Scenario: pfSense system with OpenVPN

It is planned to 

- setup and manage an OpenVPN server on the pfSense system
- use Client Certificates for user authentication on the pfSense system
- maintain the (Client) Certfiate within the pfSense system

Therefore an Intermediate CA Certificate has to be prepared on the workstation and installed on the pfSense system. In result the pfSense system will become capable of creating its required certificates.

Steps to follow are

1. "Configure Certificate Authority"
2. "Configure Intermediate Certificate Authority"
3. "Configure Web Certificate"
4. "Activate Own Web Certificate"
5. "Test Own Web Certificate"

### Configure Certificate Authority

- ⬆ select menu option "**System** > **Certificates**"
     - navigate to tab "**Authorities**"
     - ⬆ click "**➕ Add**"
          - ✏️✓ type **`cacommonnameca`** (the CN part of the certificate) as "**Descriptive name**"
          - ✏️✓ select **`Import an existing Certificate Authority`** as "**Method**"
          - ✏️✓ enable "**Trust Store**"
          - open the `cacrtfileca` file and copy the content into the clipboard
          - ✏️✓ paste the content of the clipboard into "**Certificate data**"
          - ✓🔙 click "**💾 Save**"

### Configure Intermediate Certificate Authority

When you have setup already ACNO, only a few more steps are required to create those files required.

## DHCP Client - Fix IP-Address

In some cases it is desired to have a system within the DMZ/LAN network with a fixed IP-Address. Usually we would specify the IP-Address on the device itself. As an alternative, the pfSense own DHCP/DHCPv6 Server can be used to achieve the same.

Beside the IP-Address(es), another prerequisite is to have the MAC address and/or DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID) at hand.

- DHCP Server: the MAC address¹ of the client device
- DHCPv6 Server: DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID)¹ of the client device
- DHCP/DHCPc6 Server: the client device IP-Address(es)

¹ Especially DUID has to be taken from the lease page of pfSense system; See menu option "**Status > DHCP Leases**" and "**Status > DHCPv6 Leases**" respectively.

Once the static mapping is completed, the client device has to be rebooted to get the assigned IP-Address.

Note: *In case of an Wifi Interface, used by the client device, not randmon MAC address should be used!*

### DHCP Static Mappings

From the DNS perspective additional changes are required, in order to forward requests on the public domain to the server in the DMZ.

The following steps are required to a domain specifc "**Host Overrides**" entry in the "**DNS Resolver,

| Host | Parent domain of host | IP to return from host | Description | Actions |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ddprefixdomaindd | ddbasedomaindd | aohostipv4addressao | DynDNS Provider Name | 🖉 🗑 |

with "**Additional Names for this Host**" entry in the "**Host Override**" definition.

| ddofficedd | ddprefixdomaindd.ddbasedomaindd | Online Office Solution | 🗑 Delete |
| ddturndd | ddprefixdomaindd.ddbasedomaindd | STURN/TURN Server | 🗑 Delete |

Note: Usually the DynDNS provider has a set of domain names, to be used as the base domain name (e.g. "ddbasedomaindd") and the own - individual - part is the prefix/host ("ddprefixdomaindd") to it. As IP is only the IPv4 address given, in case of IPv4+IPv6 the have to be specified by `aohostipv4addressao,aohostipv6addressao`.

    Potential DNS Rebind attack detected, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding
    Try accessing the router by IP address instead of by hostname.

The previously used DSL-Router has to be removed as DNS-Server from the configuration. Instead the DNS-Server (PRIDNS/SECDNS) from the PPPoE connection have to be taken.

- ⬆ select menu option "**System > General Setup**"
     - focus on "**DNS Server Settings**"
     - ✏️✓ remove entries for "**DNS Server**"

     - ✓ click on "**💾 Save**"

## DSL-Router usage (default scenario)

### Allow DSL-Router LAN traffic

In case of having other systems connected to the DSL-Router, beside of pfSense, it might be needed to allow those other systems to communicate with pfSense and/or other systems on the pfSense LAN.

By default this kind of traffic is blocked by pfSense. See Firewall Rules

- ⬆ select menu option "**Firewall > Rules**"
     - navigate to tab "**WAN**"

The first colums of list "Rules (Drag to Change Order)" looks like the following for the first two lines:

| ☐ |  | States | Protocol | Source | Port |
| :---: | :---: | ---: | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| ☐ | ❌ | 0/0 B | * | RFC 1918 networks | * |
| ☐ | ❌ | 0/0 B | * | Reserved Not assigned by IANA | * |

Note: *These rule got automatically created based on the WAN interface definition. In order to remove these rules, the interface configuration has to be adjusted.*

#### Adjust WAN Interface configuration

- ⬆ select menu option "**Interfaces > WAN**"
     - focus on "**Reserved Networks**"
     - ✏️✓ ~~disable~~ "**Block private networks and loopback addresses**" ("Blocks traffic from IP addresses that are reserved for private networks ...")

## Guest Network

We are going to setup a new network, which has Internet-Access only. It is a different approach than [Internet Access Control](#internet-access-control), as any system within the Guest Network will have **only** Internet-Access and being completely isolated from the other networks.

The Guest Network can be either used directly via LAN or Wi-Fi, if conneced to a Wi-Fi Access Point (AP). As AP even a participation with a wireless community network e.g. Freifunk is possible. Especially for the last case such a Guest Network should be used instead of a regular LAN, as the AP is not fully under controll of ourself.

## Internet Access Control

QQQ TODO QQQ

With more and more devices - black boxes - coming with a WiFi and/or LAN connection, the device owner do want to have controll on the devices communication. Either to prevent automatic updates or calling home.

In case a network connection and/or App is required for the activation of a device ... most likely such requirement is not advertised nor mentioned anywhere ... DO RETURN THE DEVICE and request your money back.

Usually these devices have a known¹ MAC address and use DHCP to aquire an IP-Address.

¹ If the device has a label with the MAC address, that is easy. But even without such label and/or usage of IPv6, the MAC address and/or DUID can be identified by looking at the DHCP leases (**Status > DHCP Leases**" & "**Status > DHCPv6 Leases**"). Looking at the leases and connecting a device should be done with the COMPLETE traffic from the LAN being blocked.

### General Allow-List



Alias > IP
focus on section "**Properties**"

### Dedicated Deny-List

Basically the steps are the following.

1. Create a DHCP Static Mapping based on the MAC address / DUID (identifier). See [**DHCP Client - Fix IP-Address**](#dhcp-client---fix-ip-address)
2. Create/maintaine a Host(s) Alias list called "IoT Devices" with the devices name (see Step 1.)
3. Create/maintaine a Block Rule list called "Deny IoT Devices Traffic" with the Source Alias "IoT Devices" (see Step 2.)
4. In case certain Internet addresses should be allowed, create/maintaine a Allow Rule list called "Allow IoT Devices Traffic" with the Source Alias "IoT Devices" (see Step 2.)

Note: Businesses should buy a pfSense+ subscription, as this product variant comes with the feature "**Ethernet (Layer 2) Rules**" (incl. filtering on MAC addresses).

## User/Group Management

### Group - Create

Have a User-Group available, with members been able to use the IPsec VPN connection.

- ⬆ select menu option "**System** > **User Manager**"
     - navigate to tab "**Groups**"
     - ⬆ click on "**➕ Add**"
          - ✏️✓ type **`<group-short-name>`** in "**Group name**"
          - keep selected **`Local`** for **Scope**
          - ✏️✓ type **`<group-description>`** in "**Description**"

### User - Assign SSH Public Key

#### Prerequisites

- User already exists
- the public key of the workstation exists

In case you have no ssh-key pair yet ... create it using the following command (and press ENTER when asked for passphrase)

As long as we use the `@` in the `ssh fwadminfw@fwhostnamefw.fwhostdomainfw` command, the name of the workstations account is irrelevant. All what counts is the public key `id_rsa.pub` for authentication.

```console
$ ls ~/.ssh
known_hosts  known_hosts.old
```

If files `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` are listed as well, you have already prepared your workstation and therefor have to skip the following commands.

```console
fwadminfw@iThink:~$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/fwadminfw/.ssh/id_ed25519): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/fwadminfw/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /home/fwadminfw/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:WzMNibmeNE8UuiMKpX1ZtfIBvo3vg7uO9bMH2a4VJHs fwadminfw@iThink
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|        . o      |
|       . * +     |
|    .   B B .    |

|       o.oo.o    |
|      ..+o=*     |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

```console
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "wssysuserws wshostws" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/wssysuserws/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /home/wssysuserws/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:z5s8Vby75poeVE4YfRK3jnAZ/RFaHjMPIn5fLRj2xZI wssysuserws wshostws
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|          o      |
|         . = o . |
|          E *.**o|
