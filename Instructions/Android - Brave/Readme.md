¹ Requires a restart of the browser.

² Keep the notifications on, in general. Later, while using the app, you are going to tell Android which notification you are no longer interested in.

³ Here I fully rely on the trustworthy [author](https://www.kuketz-blog.de) and his [german explanation on  uBlock Origin usage](https://www.kuketz-blog.de/ublock-origin-schutz-gegen-tracker-und-werbung/). Thanks a million.
I do not know how to deal with "Filterliste »[Actually Legitimate URL Shortener Tool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/LegitimateURLShortener.txt)« über die Importfunktion hinzufügen" and therefore leaving it out for the moment. Once the wisdom has kissed me, I will incorporate this part as well.


Notes: 

The first kind of notification to be ignored is "Close private tabs?". Fir this one and other, do the following steps:
- press and hold on the message
- Android offers now to change the message behaviour
- 🪜 tap on "Turn off notifications"
	- 👁 watch the blinking option, as this is the notification you want to turn off
	- ✓🖉 ~~disable~~ the kind of notification, you do not want to see anymore
	- ✓🛝 tap on "**Apply**" (switch from "**Done**" a change)
